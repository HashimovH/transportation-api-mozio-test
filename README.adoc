## My thoughts about Application Local Setup

In my opinion, `docker-compose` or another lightweight container orchestration tool is the best solution for making application up in the local environment.

### Prequisite
Clone the repository by using `git clone https://github.com/HashimovH/transportation-api-mozio-test` command and then `cd transportation-api-mozio-test`

### Running via Docker
```
docker build -t mozio-test .
docker run -p 8080:8080 mozio-test
```

command will create container in the `8080` port and it will provide gRPC **reflection** since settings contains `APP_ENV=development` inside compose file.


### Using uvicorn

If you want to start application without containers, after setting up your machine's Python settings, you can achieve it by running `uvicorn app.main:app --port=8000 --reload` in the root folder.
